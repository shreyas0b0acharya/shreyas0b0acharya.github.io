In the quiet of dawn, the world awakes,
Whispering secrets the night forsakes.
Dew-kissed petals in the morning light,
A canvas of dreams, soft and bright.

Birdsong weaves through the gentle breeze,
Echoes of love, among the trees.
Footsteps fade on paths of yesterday,
As dawn gives birth to a brand-new day.

Sunrise paints the sky in hues of fire,
Hope blooms anew, lifting spirits higher.
In this embrace of dawn's tender grace,
Life unfolds with each new embrace.
